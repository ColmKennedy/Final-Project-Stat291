# Exploratory Data Analysis

### Population

The populations are skewed right, meaning there are fewer high populations. Most populations lie between 4.6 million and 32 million. Population does not seem correlated with life expectancy, r = 0.05.

```{r}
summary(all$population)

ggplot(data = all, mapping = aes(x = population)) +
  geom_histogram(color = 'white') +
  scale_x_continuous(labels = scales::comma)

ggplot(data = all, mapping = aes(x = population, y = lifeexp)) + 
  geom_point()+
  geom_smooth(method = 'lm', se = FALSE)



# Correlation
get_correlation(all, formula = lifeexp ~ population)
# very low corr life exp and pop
```


### Child Mortality ***

Child mortality and life expectancy have an extremely high negative correlation, r = -0.91. The plot illustrates a strong linear relationship. This is a very good indicator of life expectancy, and a great candidate for our model.

```{r}
summary(all$childmort)

ggplot(data = all, mapping = aes(x = childmort, y = lifeexp)) + 
  geom_point()+
  geom_smooth(method = 'lm', se = FALSE)

get_correlation(all, formula = lifeexp ~ childmort)
# Extremely strong correlation

```


### Income ***

Income and life expectancy are also highly correlated, r = 0.72. The relationship appears logarithmic, applying log to income appears to make the relationship linear. This is another good candidate for our model.

```{r}
# Income

summary(all$income)

ggplot(data = all, mapping = aes(x = income, y = lifeexp)) + 
  geom_point()+
  geom_smooth(method = 'lm', se = FALSE)


ggplot(data = all, mapping = aes(x = log(income), y = lifeexp)) + 
  geom_point()+
  geom_smooth(method = 'lm', se = FALSE)


get_correlation(all, formula = lifeexp ~ income)
# Strong correlation
```

### Income and Child Mortality

Income and child mortality appear to have a relationship with each other and may be interacting. They are negatively correlated, r = -0.64. After applying log to income, the relationship appears much more linear. It would be worth trying an interaction model with income and child mortality. 

```{r}
ggplot(data = all, mapping = aes(x = income, y = childmort)) + 
  geom_point()+
  geom_smooth(method = 'lm', se = FALSE)


ggplot(data = all, mapping = aes(x = log(income), y = childmort)) + 
  geom_point()+
  geom_smooth(method = 'lm', se = FALSE)

get_correlation(all, formula = childmort ~ income)

```

#Murder
```{r}

ggplot(data=all, aes(x=murder)) + geom_histogram(color = "white")

cor(all$lifeexp, all$murder)

ggplot(data=all, aes(x=murder, y=lifeexp)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth(method = 'lm', se = FALSE)
```

#Analysis: After observing the correlation coefficient between lifeexp and murder it was clear that the relationship between the two was very weak. As a result, when plotted on a scatterplot the projected line is almost a horizontal line. Although the murder variable does not have as big an impact on lifeexp, murder may be closely related to another variable to create a influential factor for lifeexp. Further analysis with its colinearity with other variables would be needed.


#GDPCapita
```{r}
ggplot(data=all, aes(x=gdpcapita)) + geom_histogram(color = "white")

cor(all$lifeexp, all$gdpcapita)

ggplot(data=all, aes(x=gdpcapita, y=lifeexp)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth(method = 'lm', se = FALSE)

model1 <- lm(data=all, lifeexp~gdpcapita)
get_regression_table(model1)
get_regression_summaries(model1)

all2 <- all %>% mutate(lifeexp=log(lifeexp), gdpcapita=log(gdpcapita))
model2 <- lm(data=all2, lifeexp~gdpcapita)
get_regression_table(model2)
get_regression_summaries(model2)


ggplot(data=all2, aes(x=gdpcapita, y=lifeexp)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth(method = 'lm', se = FALSE) 
```

#Analysis: After taking a look at the relatively hight correlation coefficient between gdpcapita and lifeexp, I saw that plotting a scatterplot with a regression line of lifeexp on gdpcapita showed that the pattern of points followed a exponential curve rather than a linear line. So after taking a look at the log of lifeexp on log of gdpcapita, the scatterplot shows that the points more closely follow the regression line. The relationship between gdpcapita and lifeexp is a positive one that shows that as gdpcapita increases, so does lifeexp.


#HealthSpend
```{r}
ggplot(data=all, aes(x=healthspend)) + geom_histogram(color = "white")

cor(all$lifeexp, all$healthspend)

ggplot(data=all, aes(x=healthspend, y=lifeexp)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth(method = 'lm', se = FALSE)

model3 <- lm(data=all, lifeexp~healthspend)
get_regression_table(model3)
get_regression_summaries(model3)

all3 <- all %>% mutate(lifeexp=log(lifeexp), healthspend=log(healthspend))
model4 <- lm(data=all3, lifeexp~healthspend)
get_regression_table(model4)
get_regression_summaries(model4)


ggplot(data=all3, aes(x=healthspend, y=lifeexp)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth(method = 'lm', se = FALSE) 
```

#Analysis: The correlation coefficient between lifeexp and healthspend is 0.592, which shows that there is a positive relationship between healthspend and lifeexp. Further examining this relationship, the scatterplot of the relationship shows a exponential curve of the data points. After applying the log() function to lifeexp and healthspend, we can see more clearly how the data points on the plot appear to be closer to the projected positive regression line.
